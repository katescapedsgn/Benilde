					<p><strong><blockquote>Micro needling with stem cell serum with facial</blockquote></strong></p>
					<p>A slightly aggressive procedure, not for the faint at heart. But then again a little sacrifice won’t hurt right? Known to the Medical World as Collagen Induction therapy, this procedure involves repeatedly puncturing the skin with tiny, sterile needles (microneedling the skin) in order to induce endogenous production of cutaneous collagen. An automated microneedle stamping device, or "microneedling pen", powered by a motor and adjusted for frequency (stamps/second) and depth of the microneedles is used. This clinic procedure is solely and specifically done by our board certified dermatologist under topical anesthesia. Sited as the next big thing, microneedling thus address a lot of skin issues. A new treatment modality for the treatment of scars, especially acne scars, stretch marks, wrinkles, and for facial rejuvenation as well.</p>

						<h6><span class="lnr lnr-chevron-down"></span>lift & needle scar treatment with facial</h6>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="desc">
					<p>Microneedles by itself has been proven to mechanically stimulate skin tissue to produce collagen. On the other hand, thermalift, with principles of heat supply and distribution to deep layers of the skin, is also a great collagen stimulator as well. Back up by research, heat has been shown cause new collagen formation, repair and tightening. Why not have the best of both world then? With the use of microneedles that are able to deliver heat, skin is doubly activated thus, better and faster collagen remodeling. But then there’s more! By piercing skin with the minute needles, therapeutics blends can be applied and diffuse to much deep layers versus just plain application on the surface of our integumentary system.</p>

						<h6><span class="lnr lnr-chevron-down"></span>fractional co2 laser</h6>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="desc">
					<p>Also known as LASER resurfacing, this state of the art technology applies the same philosophy of delivering heat to stimulate collagen. Again, the ever famous “collagen”, the diva protein of the connective tissue organization, the main lead role that keeps skin plump and wrinkle free.  How unfortunate that it naturally ages and cannot stand the complications of sun exposure, pollution and trauma (better known as Acne!). To a sophisticated rescue is the Fractional CO2 Laser that uses beamlets of energy light to bore petite holes in the skin, pushing the body’s natural collagen production on fast-forward mode. And since it discretely focuses on the root level, it succeeds to unharm the outer skin layers and its surrounding areas. Maximum results with negligible recuperation time.</p>

						<h6><span class="lnr lnr-chevron-down"></span>deep chemical peel</h6>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="desc">
					<p>Deep scars need deeper help! An issue that cannot be address by just ordinary peels. With Dermatologist supervision, skin is subjected to more potent (stronger) medically approved elements in fluid forms to smoothly glaze the skin surface up to a desirable and allowed depth of skin. Result is a more thick skin sloughing off unwanted imperfections.</p>

					<p>Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) uses flashlamps to produce high intensity light over broad visible and infrared wavelengths that select the desired range.Complicated! Simply put, it gives out intense heat to induce controlled wounds under the skin, forcing itself to heal and create new cells. IPL thru a variety of filtered lens (guided by required light wavelength) is used to remedy skin discolorations, rosacea, melasma, acne, photodamage, vascular and pigmented lesions, and rhytides. It is also a superior treatment to erase signs of skin maturity, hence, has been one of the in demand tool for skin rejuvenation. It is non-invasive with minimal discomfort. The procedure is quick, safe and well tolerated.Better progress is achieved with successive sessions.</p>

						<h6><span class="lnr lnr-chevron-down"></span>botox</h6>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="desc">
					<p>Botulinum toxin is an effective blocker of nerve activity in the muscles, causing a temporary reduction in muscle activity. Botox Cosmetic is used to temporarily minimize the appearance of facial wrinkles. By limiting movement of facial muscles, facial lines are avoided and less noticeable. Botox injections should be given only by a trained and knowledgeable medical professional, even when used for cosmetic purposes. By this, We assure you that our Dermatologists are skilled and highly qualified to administer botox injections. Injection may be given into more than one area at a time, depending on the condition and extent of area being treated. It is usually re-administered every 3 to 6 months. It is a must that you inform your Doctor of any medical conditions to attain utmostsafety. And, strictly follow post procedure instructions for optimal result.</p>

						<h6><span class="lnr lnr-chevron-down"></span>dermal fillers</h6>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="desc">
					<p>Dermal fillers are injected to fade facial lines and restore mass and fullness in the face.</p>
					<p>As we age, our skin naturally lose deep soft tissue and fat. This is more extensive especially on sun exposed areas and skin frequently subjected to pollution and other unsolicited toxicities in the environment. As the volume pad underneath the skin is loss, the facial muscles also fuses closer to the skin surface, making its movementsapparent.Consequently, the obvious smile lines and crow’s feet. The skin also loses its elasticity and slackens. Such sad words to hear!</p>
					<p>Dermal fillers is effective in managing this problem as it adds substance and fill in underneath gaps. Dermal Fillers can also be used to plump thin lips, augment shallow contours and plump sunken scars.</p>
					<p>Dermal fillers can be very helpful in those with early signs of aging, or as a part of a multidisciplinary approach in management of facial rejuvenation surgery. The need for re-injection or frequency of administration will depend on the type of filler that will be used. Our competent Dermatologist would be happy to assist you with your queries.</p>
